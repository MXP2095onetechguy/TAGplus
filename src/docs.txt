Documentation for The Apul Game+

This is a documentation for the game.

=GAMEPLAY
To play as Abby, you just click around the screen. The game is built for mouse controls only.
There are two types of DMKids. The bouncer and the zipper.
The bouncer just bounces from left to right. The zipper dashes across before dropping down.
There are 3 items.
- Apul - Gain score
- High Heel - Gain helth
- Golden Apul - Explode away all the DMKids

Turb mode is a harder version. Less helth, more intense song, and more DMKids.

=JUKEBOX
Its a jukebox. It allows you to listen to the songs without having to worry about gameplay.
To exit, just click anywhere while on the jukebox screen.

=CREDITS & DOCS
Its for crediting all the used parts of the game.
It also instructs you how to extract the .love file to access the attributions, licensing info and this documentation.
It can also show this documentation as a dialog box.
TLDR: A guide and credit screen.

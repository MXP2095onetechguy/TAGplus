Documentation for The Apul Game+

This is a documentation for the game.

=GAMEPLAY
To play as Abby, you just click around the screen. The game is built for mouse controls only.
There are two types of DMKids. The bouncer and the zipper.
The bouncer just bounces from left to right. The zipper dashes across before dropping down.
There are 3 items.
- Apul - Gain score
- High Heel - Gain helth
- Golden Apul - Explode away all the DMKids

Turb mode is a harder version. Less helth, more intense song, and more DMKids.

=JUKEBOX
Its a jukebox. It allows you to listen to the songs without having to worry about gameplay.
To exit, just click anywhere while on the jukebox screen.

=CREDITS & DOCS
Its for crediting all the used parts of the game.
It can also show this documentation as a dialog box.
TLDR: A guide and credit screen.


=HOW TO ACCESS THE ATTRIBS, LICENSE AND INTERNALS
First, somehow extract the contents from the .love file, .app,  or .exe.
With the .love file, just unzip it like a zip file as its a zip file.
    - Rename .love file to zip
    - Unzip the newly renamed file
With the .app file, you can access the insides.
    - Right click and click on show package content
    - Go to the contents folder and go to the resources folder
    - You should see a .love file. Unzip it just like how you unzip .love files.
With the .exe and .appimage file, you better pray and cry because Idk how to do the extraction.

=CONFIGURATION
This game can be configured with a .env file.
To do so, pass the .env file on the command line with the --config flag.
It should look like this: [blah blah love exec or zip] --config cfg.env
Or this for realism: love tagplus.love --config cfg.env

here are some options
- CLASSICBGM -> Select for the classic BGM instead of the new one. (true/false)
